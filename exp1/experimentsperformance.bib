    abstract = {{The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis "At last, a welcome and
needed text for computer professionals who require practical, ready-to-apply
techniques for performance analysis. Highly recommended!" -Dr. Leonard
Kleinrock University of California, Los Angeles "An entirely refreshing text
which has just the right mixture of theory and real world practice. The book
is ideal for both classroom instruction and self-study." -Dr. Raymond L.
Pickholtz President, IEEE Communications Society "An extraordinarily
comprehensive treatment of both theoretical and practical issues." -Dr.
Jeffrey P. Buzen Internationally recognized performance analysis expert ". it
is the most thorough book available to date" -Dr. Erol Gelenbe Universit\'{e} Ren\'{e}
Descartes, Paris ". an extraordinary book.. A worthy addition to the bookshelf
of any practicing computer or communications engineer" -Dr. Vinton G. Cer???
Chairman, ACM SIGCOMM "This is an unusual object, a textbook that one wants to
sit down and peruse. The prose is clear and fluent, but more important, it is
witty." -Allison Mankin The Mitre Washington Networking Center Newsletter}},
