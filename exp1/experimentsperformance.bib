    abstract = {{The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis "At last, a welcome and
needed text for computer professionals who require practical, ready-to-apply
techniques for performance analysis. Highly recommended!" -Dr. Leonard
Kleinrock University of California, Los Angeles "An entirely refreshing text
which has just the right mixture of theory and real world practice. The book
is ideal for both classroom instruction and self-study." -Dr. Raymond L.
Pickholtz President, IEEE Communications Society "An extraordinarily
comprehensive treatment of both theoretical and practical issues." -Dr.
Jeffrey P. Buzen Internationally recognized performance analysis expert ". it
is the most thorough book available to date" -Dr. Erol Gelenbe Universit\'{e} Ren\'{e}
Descartes, Paris ". an extraordinary book.. A worthy addition to the bookshelf
of any practicing computer or communications engineer" -Dr. Vinton G. Cer???
Chairman, ACM SIGCOMM "This is an unusual object, a textbook that one wants to
sit down and peruse. The prose is clear and fluent, but more important, it is
witty." -Allison Mankin The Mitre Washington Networking Center Newsletter}},

    abstract = {{Box and Meyer (1986) introduced a method for assessing the sizes of contrasts in unreplicated factorial and fractional factorial designs. This is a useful technique, and an associated graphical display popularly known as a Bayes plot makes it even more effective. This article presents a competing technique that is also effective and is computationally simple. An advantage of the new method is that the results are given in terms of the original units of measurement. This direct association with the data may make the analysis easier to explain.}},
