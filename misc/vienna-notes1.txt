1. Reality check 
   * Spider SPARQL endpoints to check caching features
   * Spider other RDF sources?
   => Workshop paper

2. Cache results and prefetch
   * Only safe queries (BNODE hell, unprojected variables, FILTERs)
   * triple / BGP + ServiceURI  Wildcards? 
     	    => (workshop paper recommending hash?)

   * Value : RDF binary serialization (to RAM or disk) 
   * Metadata : 
     	      * The query, 
	      * frequency counts, 
	      * last-modified?,
	      * content-length, 
	      * triple-count?

3. What kind of query processing in CDN / Forward proxy

=> Conference paper

4. Subquery pattern mining

5. Cost model
   * Simplifying assumption: Rely on HTTP headers to asses freshness

=> Conference paper
