Title = {Querying the Web of Interlinked Datasets using {VOID} Descriptions},
Booktitle = {LDOW 2012 : linked Data on the web (LDOW2012)},
Year = {2012},
Abstract = {Querying the web of data is a functioning of the Semantic Web. Today, the Semantic Web is characterized as a Web of interlinked datasets, and thus querying web can be seen as dataset integration on the web. Also, this dataset integration must be transparent from the user as if she is querying the whole web. In this paper, we introduce a federated query engine called WoDQA (Web of Data Query Analyzer) which uses VOID standard and automates dataset discovery for a query on the web. Query federation includes two stages which the first one is dataset selection and the latter one is query optimization. WoDQA focuses on powerful dataset elimination and analyzes query structure in detail besides using predicate indexes. Thus, dataset and linkset descriptions in VIOD stores are analyzed for a SPARQL query and a federated query on web of interlinked datasets is constructed. By virtue of linkset concept, WoDQA integrates links between datasets into selection of federated data sources.},
