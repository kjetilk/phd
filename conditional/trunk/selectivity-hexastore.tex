\begin{abstract}
In this paper we see how the common assumption of independence of the
selectivity of RDF nodes can be abandoned. We shall also find it
instructive to explore how selectivity can be determined exactly by
using index size for a Hexastore triple store. Finally, we will
suggest further directions for selectivity estimation in the
conditional regime.

\section{Introduction}
Several authors have studied the use of selectivity estimation for
optimizing SPARQL query execution plans, both in the context of Basic
Graph Patterns \cite{Stocker:2008:SBG:1367497.1367578}.
