I would like to thank the reviewers for their extensive reviews. 

I would first like to address the main point of critisism voiced
mainly by Review 4 but also by Review 2, that the survey is of a very
limited "Semantic Web" and so is unlikely to be generalizeable. 

This critisism is very valid and taken to heart. Indeed, this survey
is not meant to be generalizeable beyond the current state of the art,
as I find it quite likely that the current state must change in order
for the Semantic Web to be successful. The scope of the survey is a
snapshot, confined to what this community can reasonably do something
about, and currently, we are such a tiny fraction of the Web, that we
have to understand the Web better to succeed.

This survey is not intended as means to understand what the rest of
the Web is doing right and wrong, that wisdom is available elsewhere
in the broader literature, but as I tried not to pass judgement,
except in a small number of cases where current practice is clearly
severely flawed, it was not within my scope, nor the pagelimit, to
cite.

The intention is mostly to have empirical research to counter
statements like "it is no point in using caches when evaluating SPARQL
queries, since no endpoints are exposing them".
