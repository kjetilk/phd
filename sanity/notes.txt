In many common use cases, ontologies are not relevant to query
answering since they usually occur in bound terms. It is interesting
to understand caching when this is not the case. Moreover, many
ontologies are maintained by a small group of humans and change

consist of many information resources with just a few triples in
each. Since they appear to be produced by the same software, usually
Semantic Mediawiki, we assume that they are configured with a single
setup, and thus we will merely sample these resources.

The main motivation for scanning ontologies is to find
