\section{Introduction}

Caching has been given a prominent place in the foundational documents
of the World Wide Web. Out of the 6 documents that make up the HTTP
1.1 standard, RFC7234 \todo{ref} is entirely devoted to the topic, and
RFC7232 defines conditional requests, which is also important when
constructing caches. As the former notes:
\begin{quote} 
  The goal of caching in HTTP/1.1 is to significantly improve
  performance by reusing a prior response message to satisfy a current
  request.
\end{quote}
Furthermore, the Architecture of the World Wide Web \todo{ref}
discusses caching throughout, and the definition of the
Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style \todo{ref}
is partly motivated from the requirement to implement efficient
caching. We also note that caching in the Internet infrastructure,
through so-called Content Delivery Networks, is both a large business
area and something that could provide great value to the Semantic Web
community.

In spite of this, we have not seen it in widespread use, and therefore
we decided to conduct a survey to investigate the actual compliance to
RFC7234 and RFC7232. Our reasons to do this include
\begin{enumerate}
\item Understand the actual usage rather than rely on anecdotal
  conceptions.
\item Encourage the implementation of these mechanisms in Semantic Web
  infrastructure.
\item Point out future research directions.
\end{enumerate}

We note that caching is not only useful for long-living information
resources, even though that may be the most important. If a resource
is frequently requested, it may make sense to cache it even though it
may be fresh for only a very short period.

Caching may be deployed at several different levels: A HTTP cache may
be in a reverse proxy close to the server, in which case it may have
much in common with a conventional database cache. It may also be
anywhere between a server and a client, in which case it may be
shared, i.e. it may cache responses from several servers served to
several clients. Another example is an institutional forward proxy,
which are close to several users. Finally, the User Agent may
implement a private cache for its user at the client side.

Caching, as defined in RFC7234, requires that the server declares how
long into the future it expects the information resource in the
response to remain valid. Based on this, the client need not contact
the server at all to reuse a cached response, but this requires a
commitment from the content provider. The standard also gives the
client an opportunity to heuristically determine a time to
live. RFC7232, on the other hand, defines a protocol for asking the
server if the cached response is still fresh using conditional
requests. This doesn't burden the content provider with the task of
estimating the time to live beforehand, but then, it must be able to
answer if the resource has changed less expensively than serving the
entire response. These two approaches can be combined, as a client may
ask if a response is fresh after it has expired.
