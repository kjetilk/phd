Response variables

Timing Response Variables:
* Total time after DNS lookup
* Time for connection
* Time to first byte
* Time to transfer all data

Backend system responses:
* Total RAM use for system
* Unshared RAM based on Linux SMAPS
* Unshared RAM on other OSes
* Memory in swapped pages
* CPU time
* IO Handles used


Factors:

High-level dataset parameters:
* Number of triples in dataset
* Heterogenity of dataset

Backend System categories:
* Implementation (query engine and quad store)
* Hardware platform (typically use two different)
* Important configuration parameters

Language features:
(general methodology: Follow grammar,
