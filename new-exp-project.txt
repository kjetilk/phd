Practical implications of the New Experimentalism on evaluations of RDF database performance

I have argued in TODOref and TODOref the scientific methodology has some severe shortcomings, causing conclusions on performance to be non-generaliseable beyond the context of the evaluation itself. I have also argued that there are some fundamental difficulties with regards to testing hypotheses against a reality that does not yet exist. 

Such problems have philosophical dimensions, and previously, I have sought guidance in older texts in philosophy of science, texts that are commonly have a place in philosophy of science courses for natural scientists. However, as argued in TODOref, I have found little help in those texts.

I would like to propose a project to study contemporary philosophies of science, and to explore their practical implications on evaluation methodology.

In TODOref, we explored the use of statistical Design of Experiments for SPARQL endpoint evaluation. In my preliminary study, this methodology seems like a good fit with a direction in philosophy of science known as "The New Experimentalism". This direction argues that it is not sufficient just to test, but it must be argued that the test is severe, i.e. it would
