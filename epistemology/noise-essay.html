              This essay takes the view of Semantic Web as a

              evaluating approaches against a reality that is being

            <p>
              The naive depiction of science is that it rapidly
              advances human knowledge, using clear methodology, by
              the cumulative addition of knowledge. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Let us take as a starting point assume that science has
              indeed a remarkable rate of progress because scientists
              use methodologies that are uniquely suited to enhance
              the common understanding of phenomena, and thereby
              create new knowledge. This is an important motivation
              for research, since using science may accelerate the
              progress of the Semantic Web. 
            </p>
            <p>
              If this is true, it means that we cannot content
              ourselves with testing individual hypotheses, we must
              have methodologies to understand how a hypothesis would
              fit more generally into the Semantic Web. Then, we have
              to understand the nature of knowledge to understand the
              methodology that is used. So, what does it mean to
              <em>know</em> something?  That is one of the questions
              epistemologists concern themselves with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, the question is if we can improve the rate of
              progress towards a Semantic Web by developing
              methodologies based on an improved understanding of
              epistemology.
            </p>
            <p id="semweb-is-what">
              The problem is not only epistemological, but also
              ontological: There isn't a clear, shared idea of what
              the Semantic Web is, and possibly, there shouldn't
              be. Clearly, the article in Scientific American from
              2001 [<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">1</a>] has been an
              influential vision, but my own vision predates that, and
              is somewhat different: I don't need the very intelligent
              agents for my vision, I just need a Semantic Web that is
              as ubiquitous as the Web is today, and that brings down the
              cost of information integration. Neither of these
              visions of the Semantic Web exists today. Others may be
              content with the state of Linked Open Data or the use of
              large ontologies today, and therefore conclude that the
              Semantic Web exists.  I would disagree, the number of
              JSON APIs with little semantics, the number of datasets
              based on comma-separated values, etc., overshadow the
              Semantic Web approaches completely. However, they do not
              provide the power to realise the applications envisioned
              in the <em>revolutionary</em> scenarios. It is my
              contention that the Semantic Web <em>is</em>
              revolutionary. For the purpose of this discussion, the
              most important trait of the Semantic Web is that it
              doesn't yet exist.
            </p>
            <p>
              The rate of progress has not been what I expected when
              I first got interested in the Semantic Web around the
              time when the <a TODO
              href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Semantic.html">Semantic
              Web Roadmap</a> was written. Can this lack of progress
              be explained in part by a lack of epistemological
              clarity, resulting in that the sizeable academic
              Semantic Web community has failed to provide scientific
              guidance to the development? And if so, why?

              Popper</span> struggled with the problem of demarcation,
              i.e., a clear criterion that could tell science apart
              from pseudo-science. Popper argued that the method of
              science is one where <em>falsifiability</em> is of
              central importance, since a single counterexample can
              prove a hypothesis wrong. Therefore, Popper argued,
              scientific theories are those that are falsifiable, but
              haven't been proven wrong.

              For my master's thesis work [<a class="ref" href="#ref-3">3</a>],
              falsificationism provided the epistemological framework
              I needed. I worked within two large theories, Theory of
              General Relativity, and Quasar Theory. Even within these
              theories, it was easy for a student like myself to find
              an interesting point to attack, and I found that there
              were certain parts of the parameter space where my work
              would not only be falsifiable, but could point out fatal
              flaws in Quasar Theory, and therefore were
              knowable. Other parts could not do so, and therefore,
              were unknowable.

              recent philosophers.

              typeof="foaf:Person" property="foaf:name">Paul
              Feyerabend</span> attacked most aspects of the
              understanding that scientist seemed to have of
              themselves. Feyerabend rejected the idea that there is a
              scientific method, that knowledge is cumulative, that
              the rate of progress is measurably faster, and so
              on. Importantly, he accused science of having become as
              authoritarian as religions had been in the past. He
              quipped that falsificationism would destroy all of
              science. The key problem with falsificationism is that
              the whole construction around testing theories or even
              individual hypothesis usually is a very complex one. If
              an experiment fails, one cannot tell if the hypothesis
              that is being tested has actually failed, or if there's
              something wrong with auxiliary hypothesis, or if the
              experimental setup is to blame. If you test a SPARQL
              engine for performance, you cannot tell if your
              implementation is flawed, or if something is wrong with
              the benchmark. Moreover, theories sometimes take a long
              time to develop, and therefore, falsificationism may
              therefore cause premature rejection.

              typeof="foaf:Person" property="foaf:name">Thomas
              Kuhn</span> also challenged falsificationism and the
              view that science is accumulating knowledge. He also 
              insisted that philosophy of science must be based on
              the history of science. He did see science as a critical
              dialogue and emphasised the social aspects of science,
              but found no evidence that falsificationism had played
              an important role historically. He also gave us the
              terminological scaffolding of "paradigms", "normal
              science", "scientific revolutions" etc., where scientists in
              the "normal science" mode of operation are concerned
              with solving puzzles within the constraints of current
              theories. This goes on to a point where too many
              anomalies are accumulated for the theory to remain
              tenable, at which point a scientific revolution starts.
              Kuhn examines several scientific revolutions in his
              "Structure of scientific revolutions" [<a class="ref" href="#ref-5">5</a>]
              and attempts an extensive review of the revolution that
              happened in the transition from a geocentric to a
              heliocentric world view, in the "Copernican revolution"
              [<a class="ref" href="#ref-6">6</a>]. In spite of his insistence on the
              historical record as a basis of philosophy of science,
              he based important parts of it on a common myth: The
              myth that to make theory fit better to observation,
              astronomers had to add many "epicycles" to the astronomical
              model of the time. It has been showed in [<a class="ref" href="#ref-7">7</a>]
              that this did not happen. I appreciate Kuhn's
              argument against the cumulative nature of science,
              accept his emphasis on social processes and his scaffolding as
              useful. Though I agree with his view on the importance of history, his philosophy is
              otherwise hard to accept as his historical narrative is wrong.

              After this review, I find very little that can bring
              epistemological clarity or help establish a method that
              I can use in practical research.

              motivation behind the title of this essay? Without going
              into subtleties, the answer is no.
            </p>
            <p>
              To further understand my motivation, we have to discuss
              the term "theory". I have found surprisingly little
              guidance amongst philosophers as to what a theory
              is. Moreover, it is rare to see it used in our field the
              way it is used for e.g. "Theory of General Relativity",
              even rare to see the word "hypothesis" used. My own
              understanding of the term "theory" would be something
              like:
            </p>
            <dl class="definition" id="theory-def">
              <dt>Theory</dt>
              <dd>
                A theory is a coherent set of hypotheses that are held as true after 
                having been subjected to vigorous testing by a scientific community.
              </dd>
            </dl>
          <p>
            This acknowledges empirical testing as a criterion for
            knowledge, and also Kuhn's emphasis on science as a social
            endeavour. However, by mentioning "coherence" I soon
            realised that my foray into the philosophy of science is
            dangerous: Apparently, (at least some) <a TODO
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherentism">coherentists</a>
            are quite content that hypotheses are coherent and
            correspondance to reality is not required. This is
            clearly not what I intend to say, and by emphasising
            testing. Even though we are perhaps not in the position to
            appreciate the depth of the philosopher's discussions, I
            mention this to say that it should not deter us from
            having our own.
          </p>
          <p>
            By this definition, for something to be a science, it is
            not sufficient to just device any test, the scientific
            community must be capable of vigorous testing. 
          </p>
          <p id="semweb-theory-def">
            Also, with this definition, can we formulate the theories
            that are common to the work done in our community? Can we
            possible say that the "The Theory of the Semantic Web" is
            that "It is possible to build a large-scale Semantic Web"?
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, we are approaching the motivation behind the title,
            because even though those amongst us who are working with
            formal methods are highly adept at validating their
            research hypotheses with formal tests, they are still
            working with small part of a Theory of the Semantic Web.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have previously argued that empirical research in our
            field is lacking [<a class="ref" href="#ref-8">8</a>], but
            in principle we can test individual hypotheses vigorously.
            The external validity with respect to the "Theory of the
            Semantic Web" can nevertheless always be contested, based
            on the premise that the Semantic Web is a revolutionary
            technology that and does not yet exist. When it comes into
            existence it will have characteristics
            (e.g. workloads. data profiles, etc.), very different from
            what it has now. It may be permissible to extrapolate such
            characteristcs from what is presently deployed to test
            hypotheses, but the Semantic Web is currently so small
            compared to Web that I would contest the validity (relative
            to a large-scale Semantic Web) of any study based on that
            at present.
          </p>
          <p>
            Say that I successfully test a hypothesis empirically with
            sound statistical methods. Yet, this does not answer key
            questions with respect to The Theory of the Semantic
            Web. First, if my hypothesis was that we have a
            performance gain in spite of a slightly longer connection
            time, this will be incoherent with a hypothesis that the
            connection time must always be kept to a minimum. Both
            these hypotheses may have been verified independently, but
            it is only with respect to the Theory that they will find
            a meaningful context.
          </p>
          <p id="inconclusive">
            Unfortunately, that context is something that does not
            exist, we can only speculate about it. Therein lies the
            fundamental problem: Whereas other sciences are testing
            against a reality that does exist, but with unknown properties,
            we are obliged to test against a something that doesn't
            exist. Therefore, our results will always be inconclusive.

                Certainly, fundamental research in informatics doesn't
                need to be tested against the Theory of the Semantic
                Web, or for the same reasons that research on
                astrophysics doesn't need to justify its existence
                based on applications. It is beyond the scope of this
                essay to discuss such justifications. 
              </p>
              <p id="burden">
                However, a scientific work that makes the assertion
                that it forwards the Semantic Web certainly has the
                burden of proving that it does. Such papers must
                address the epistemological problems discussed in this
                essay. This requirement is equally strong regardless of
                whether the investigation uses formal or empirical
                methods.
              </p>
              <p id="ex-triplestore">
                I consider this fair: For example, a triple store, as
                a specialisation of a database management system,
                represents a distraction unless it can be argued that
                this particular specialisation is fruitful in a larger
                context.

              <p id="semweb-falsifiable">
                Moreover, we cannot make a "Theory of the Semantic
                Web" falsifiable, if one so desired. If we are
                challenged by outsiders who say that "The Semantic Web
                isn't going to work", an assertion that certainly is
                common, can we address that scientifically?

                This inconclusiveness causes the breakdown of the motivation that we
                should use science to drive development, a motivation
                I have retained because I think a remarkable rate of
                progress in the sciences can be demonstrated, in spite
                of Feyerabend's attacks. This happens because we don't
                have a way to test hypotheses without for example a
                Semantic Web workload, and without science, we cannot
                help build that Semantic Web to get that
                workload. 
              </p>
              <p id="dev-and-science">
                I have always maintained that science and engineering must
                be seen as one, when working with assertions on
                specific technologies (except in some cases, like implementing
                most standards, which is pure engineering), to ensure that
                the extrapolation between known characteristics and future
                characteristics are kept at a minimum, but I'm not sure
                this is enough anymore, the problem appears fundamental. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I therefore write this essay to start a discussion around
                methodology, a discussion that I think must be rooted in
                epistemology, and what we can hope achieving when trying
                to accelerate the Semantic Web. A new direction, that I
                find appealing is known as "The New Experimentalism", see
                e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#ref-9">9</a>]. I clearly see
                how this could be helpful in the type of study I did in
                [<a class="ref" href="#ref-8">8</a>], but despite their
                efforts, I don't see how it applies beyond that type of
                study. Moreover, I don't see any immediate contribution
                towards the understanding of the fundamental problem of
                testing against something that doesn't exist, nor a
                thorough rooting in the history of science.
