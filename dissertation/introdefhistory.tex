The present work sits in the confluence of several contemporary
efforts in the Semantic Web community. The focus is on query answering
with the SPARQL query language, with emphasis on exploiting the World
Wide Web, but it touches upon query federation, hypermedia, empiricial
methods for evaluating performance, standards compliance and even
philosophy of science. With a scope of this width, the investigation
is shallow, it is hoped that some key insights will provoke further
investigation rather than being the end of any conversations.
