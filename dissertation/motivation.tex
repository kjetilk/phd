\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}

There is a class of diverse, yet structurally similar, problems people
face nearly every day: When we book a flight, we may be interested in
a romantic getaway, yet we are forced to select the airport of
destination first. We often end up buying the same groceries because
we don't know what will taste well together. Last time I bought a car,
the two most important features was that it had 4 wheel drive and that
the trunk was long enough to fit a full-size baby stroller
length-wise. To find a property to build a home, I took into account
the sun conditions, that it was close to public transport that would
transport me to campus within a certain time frame, close to
ski tracks, abundance of uranium in the ground, number of children for
my children to play with, and an affordable price level. And once the
house was being built, I had to choose the toilet seat depending on
the frame in the wall and even a toilet seat that would fit.

The overarching problem is that even though each of these problems are
rarely encountered, there are so many such problems, that we encounter
them all the time. I would like to see a Semantic Web where the
plumber delivers his offer in a manner so that the open options can be
distinguished from the constraints, where a query can be formulated to
find the area I'd like to build my house based on such extensive
criteria, where the very rare comparison between a collapsed baby
stroller and car trunk can be done, where I will be able to cook
better food without being a chef and where I can book my travel based
on what I want to experience rather than make me choose a destination
based on lacking information.

Now, all this information exists on the Web, or at the very least, in
some database, and for the most part, the above problems can be
solved by surfing many websites. We are, however, reminded of ``Connolly's
Lament'' (due to Dan Connolly, one of the Semantic Web's early champions):
