There are several issues that make Semantic Web development difficult,
that are connected with development in current programming languages
and current Semantic Web libraries. As pointed out in \cite{darobin1},
there are few things that are simpler in contemporary programming than
to parse a string containing a tree-formatted data structure into a
tree that can be accessed directly. However, RDF makes the assumption
that the natural form of data is not a tree, but a graph, and in the
general case, it must be addressed as such.

Addressing graph data in a programming language.
